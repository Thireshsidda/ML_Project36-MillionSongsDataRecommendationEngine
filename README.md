# ML_Project36-MillionSongsDataRecommendationEngine

### Million Songs Data Recommendation Engine

This project explores recommender systems using a dataset of millions of song listenership records and corresponding metadata. It implements two recommender system algorithms:

Popularity-based Recommender System: This system recommends songs based on their overall listen count, assuming that more popular songs are generally more preferred.

Item Similarity-based Recommender System: This system recommends songs similar to those a user has listened to in the past. It calculates song similarity by analyzing co-occurrence patterns in user listening histories.

### Project Structure:

recommenders.py: This file contains the implementation of the recommender systems using Python classes.

MillionSongsDataRecommendationEngine.Ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to load the dataset, preprocess it, and use the recommender systems to generate song recommendations for users.

### Running the Project:
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with libraries like pandas (pip install pandas), numpy (pip install numpy), and scikit-learn (pip install scikit-learn).

Steps:
Clone or download the project repository.

Open MillionSongsDataRecommendationEngine.Ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Replace "triplets_file.csv" and "song_data.csv" with the actual paths to your dataset files if necessary.

Run the Jupyter Notebook cells one by one to execute the code and see the results.


### Understanding the Code:

##### recommenders.py:

This file defines two classes:

popularity_recommender_py: This class implements the popularity-based recommender system. It creates a data structure to store song listen counts and recommends songs with the highest listen counts.

item_similarity_recommender_py: This class implements the item similarity-based recommender system. It calculates the co-occurrence matrix between songs based on user listening histories and recommends songs similar to the user's past preferences.

##### MillionSongsDataRecommendationEngine.Ipynb:

This notebook performs the following steps:

Loads the song listenership data (triplets_file.csv) and song metadata (song_data.csv) files.

Preprocesses the data by combining song title and artist name into a single feature and filtering the dataset (optional).

Creates instances of the recommender system classes.

Trains the recommender systems by providing the dataset.

Generates song recommendations for specific users based on their listening history.


### Further Exploration:

Experiment with different data preprocessing techniques, such as TF-IDF for song titles, to potentially improve recommendation accuracy.

Explore more advanced recommender system algorithms like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering using song features.

Evaluate the performance of the recommender systems using metrics like precision, recall, and recommendation diversity.

Visualize the co-occurrence matrix or song similarity graphs to gain insights into song relationships.

This project provides a starting point for building recommender systems for music or similar item-based recommendation tasks. You can customize and extend the code to explore different algorithms, data sources, and evaluation methods to create more sophisticated music recommendation systems.
